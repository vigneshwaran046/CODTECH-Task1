<h1> Portfolio Website</h1>
<h3>Objective</h3>
The objective of this project is to create a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills, experience, and projects in a professional and visually appealing manner. The website serves as an online resume and a platform for potential employers and collaborators to learn more about me and my work.

<h3>Key Activities</h3>
Design and Layout: Created my portfolio website project, I began by conducting research on existing portfolio designs and UI/UX trends to gather inspiration. Using Figma, I created wireframes and structured key sections like About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact. I then focused on designing a professional and visually appealing interface that reflects my personal brand. The user experience design ensured intuitive navigation and a smooth user journey. After prototyping the website, I gathered feedback from peers to refine the design. I provided design assets and documentation for development, and finally, conducted usability tests to optimize the site's responsiveness and performance.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
Figma – For designing the UI and UX, creating wireframes, and prototyping the website.

2. **Consistency in Branding**: A cohesive design with consistent color schemes and typography reinforces your personal brand and professional image.
3. **Interactive Prototyping**: Using interactive prototypes in Figma allows for early testing and refinement of the user journey, leading to a more polished final product.
4. **Feedback Integration**: Actively seeking and incorporating feedback helps identify areas for improvement and ensures the design meets user needs.
5. **Testing and Optimization**: Conducting thorough usability tests and optimizing performance can significantly enhance the website’s functionality and user experience.
6. **Documentation for Development**: Providing clear documentation and design assets facilitates smoother development and accurate implementation of your vision.
<h3>How to Run the Project</h3>
 To view and interact with the portfolio design, open the Figma file (vigneshwaran portfolio.fig) and navigate through the pages to explore the various sections of the portfolio. Use the prototype mode ("MacBook Pro 14") to simulate user interactions and transitions. Ensure you have access to the necessary Figma permissions to view or edit the project as needed.
